"MolSysMT, Molecular Modeling Multi-Tool, is a swiss army knife to make "
"the researchers life easier and the learning barrier of new lab student "
"lower. This is done by simplifying the sintaxis of your script and "
"reducing the amount of commands you have to remind to have some simple "
"stuff done. Just that. In this sense MolSysMT is probably better defined "
"as a 'front-end', a 'wrapper' o meta-library. Thereby all credit should "
"be given to the fellows who developed and push those tools in the core of"
" MolSysMT as openmm, mdtraj, yank, mdanalysis, parmed, nglview, and many "
"others gratefully listed in the main README.md file of the source "
"repository."

"Exceptionally few home-made subroutines will be included here to fill "
"specific gaps in our needs. But this should not be, in principle, the "
"main purpose of MolSysMT."
